# Stellar Demo Wallet Server

This Stellar Demo Wallet is the backend to the demo wallet, currently it is only
used to host the stellar.toml file and also sign requests to enable ([SEP-10])
client attribution. During the signing phase of the SEP-10 flow, the wallet
client will make a request to the backend server to have the backend server sign
the challenge that was issued by the anchor server. The wallet client will then
sign the same request with the user's key before sending the challenge back to
the anchor server for verification.

### Running the Demo Wallet Server

1. Create a keypair on the Stellar network (you can use the demo wallet for
   this). The keypair will be used for the Demo Wallet Server. To test with
   contract account, youâ€™ll need an additional keypair to sign all related
   transactions.
2. Create a .env file in the package/demo-wallet-server directory.
   ```
   SERVER_PORT = 7000
   SERVER_SIGNING_KEY = <private signing key 1 generated in step 1>
   SOURCE_KEYPAIR_SECRET = <private signing key 2 generated in step 1>
   ```
3. Modify the _stellar.toml_ file in
   _package/demo-wallet-server/src/static/well_known_ Replace the
   **SIGNING_KEY** with the public key that was generated in step 1
4. Run the server
   ```
   yarn start:server
   ```
