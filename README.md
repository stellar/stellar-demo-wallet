# Stellar Demo Wallet

The Stellar Demo Wallet is our newly rebuilt application for interactively
testing anchor services. 

If you would like to automate testing of your anchor service, check out the SDF's
[anchor tests suite](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-anchor-tests) viewable
at [https://anchor-tests.stellar.org/](https://anchor-tests.stellar.org/).

This repository was originally created for the [Build a Stellar Wallet](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/building-apps/) tutorial series.
(That project has since moved over [here](https://github.com/stellar/docs-wallet)).

If you want to use parts or all of the project to kickstart your own wallet,
feel free to clone or copy any pieces that may be helpful.

## Mainnet vs. Testnet

This application defaults to using Stellar's testnet.

This application can be used on Stellar's mainnet by specifying the `REACT_APP_HORIZON_PASSPHRASE` & `REACT_APP_HORIZON_URL` environment variables when building the project.

**All accounts on mainnet that are used with this application should be considered compromised.** If you want to test services on mainnet with this tool, make sure to create a new account and fund it with the minimum assets required.

## Getting A Test Account Up and Running

You can use the demo wallet to interact with the following anchor services:

* Regulated Assets API ([SEP-8])
* Hosted Deposit and Withdrawals ([SEP-24])
* Deposit & Withdrawal API ([SEP-6])
* Cross-Border Payments API ([SEP-31])

You can connect to any domain that has a Stellar Info File (also known as [SEP-1], or a stellar.toml file). 

The instructions below are for demo-ing standard integrations supported
by Stellar test server, testanchor.stellar.org, or by the [SEP-8] reference
server, sep8-server.dev.stellar.org. For these integrations, the logs to the
right of the screen will show every network call.

### Demo-ing a Regulated Asset Payment ([SEP-8])

1. Click "Generate keypair", and then click "Create account" - this will create
   a balance of 10,000 XLM.
2. Click ‚ÄúAdd asset‚Äù and add `MYASSET` with the anchor home domain
   `sep8-server.dev.stellar.org`.
3. Click ‚ÄúAdd trustline‚Äù - this will allow you to hold MYASSET.
4. Click on the "Copy" link on the right of your public key and use that value
   to get some unities of MYASSET using the link
   `https://sep8-server.dev.stellar.org/friendbot?addr=<paste_your_address_here>`.
   Refresh the [demo-wallet page](https://demo-wallet.stellar.org/) to see funds
   in your account.
5. Select "SEP-8 Send" from the dropdown of MYASSET and click "Start" in the
   modal.
6. In the "destination" field, input an address that also has a trustline to
   MYASSET.
7. The modal will display the approval criteria used by the SEP-8 server.
   Depending on the conditions described there your payment can be automatically
   approved or you may be required to undergo an additional KYC step.
8. After your payment gets revised and signed by the SEP-8 reference server
   you'll need to review the updated transaction before the demo wallet submits
   the payment.
9. If the payment has been successfully sent you'll see "SEP-8 send payment
   completed üéâ" in the logs.

### Demo-ing a Deposit on Testnet with Hosted Deposit and Withdrawal ([SEP-24])

1. Click "Generate keypair", and then click "Create account" - this will create
   a balance of 10,000 XLM.
2. Click ‚ÄúAdd asset‚Äù and add `SRT` (this stands for Stellar Reference Token,
   it‚Äôs our representation of XLM for the test server) with the anchor home
   domain `testanchor.stellar.org`.
3. Click ‚ÄúAdd trustline‚Äù - this will allow you to hold SRT.
4. Select ‚ÄúSEP-24 deposit‚Äù from the dropdown for your SRT asset and click
   "Start" in the modal.
5. If your browser doesn't already, make sure it allows pop-ups - this is how
   the demo wallet requests KYC info.
6. Enter your name and email in the pop-up - this information doesn't need to be
   real, but the interface will want a valid email.
7. Click ‚ÄúSkip confirmation‚Äù - skipping it won't be possible in live
   integrations but helps the process move ahead in the demo.
8. Select the asset you would like to provide to the anchor. Note that there is
   no real asset you actually need to provide off-chain, it's just for
   demonstration.
9. Enter a number into the amount and click "Submit".
10. If you opted to provide "USD" in the previous form, you'll be asked to
    confirm the exchange rate from USD to SRT. Select "Confirm Transaction" to
    continue.
11. Leave the pop-up window open while you wait to see the deposit of SRT made
    to your account - you can close when you see ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù is complete and you
    have SRT.

### Demo-ing Cross-Border Payments ([SEP-31]) on Testnet

_Note: specifically in the case of demo-ing SEP-31 in the Demo Wallet, notice
the public and secret keys don't represent the Sending Client but instead the
Sending Anchor's account. In SEP-31, the only Stellar transaction happening is
between the Sending and the Receiving anchors._

1. Follow the steps above in order to establish an amount of SRT to send.
2. Select ‚ÄúSEP-31 Send‚Äù from the dropdown for your SRT asset and click "Start"
   in the modal.
3. Enter the requested information in the pop-up - none of the info has to be
   real for this testanchor.stellar.org demo, this is only to show the fields
   required. When testing another anchor you may need to adhere to their
   validation requirements.
4. If the payment has been successfully sent you'll see "SEP-31 send payment
   completed" in the logs.

### Hosting Anchor Services Locally

You can serve `stellar.toml` files from `localhost`. When using locally hosted
stellar.toml files on demo-wallet.stellar.org, some browsers might block them
for security reasons if you‚Äôre not using `https`. If you‚Äôre running the demo wallet
locally, this is not a problem.

## Running the Demo Wallet Locally

You can run the demo wallet locally, either by installing the application on your machine or by using Docker.

### Local Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

create a **.env** file in _packages/demo-wallet-client_ with the
**REACT_APP_CLIENT_DOMAIN** (where stellar.toml is hosted) and the wallet
backend **REACT_APP_WALLET_BACKEND_ENDPOINT**

NOTE: if using a locally running test anchor (in docker) use
_docker.for.mac.host.internal_, this will allow the anchor that's running in a
docker container to access the host network where the client domain (server
hosting the stellar.toml) is running. ex:

```bash
REACT_APP_CLIENT_DOMAIN=docker.for.mac.host.internal:7000
REACT_APP_WALLET_BACKEND_ENDPOINT=http://demo-wallet-server.stellar.org
```

and run:

```bash
yarn start:client
```

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
yarn build:client
```

### Docker

If you want to run the demo wallet on testnet, building the project is easy.

```bash
docker compose build
```

If you're looking to use the demo wallet to interact with mainnet services, specify the following build args.

```bash
docker compose build \
    --build-arg REACT_APP_HORIZON_PASSPHRASE="Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015" \
    --build-arg REACT_APP_HORIZON_URL="https://horizon.stellar.org"
```

Then, launch the containers.

```bash
docker compose up
```

Note that the docker compose file defaults to using SDF's demo wallet server, but you are free to edit the compose file to use a local instance of the server.
